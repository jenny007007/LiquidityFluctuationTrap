# LiquidityTrap (Drosera Proof-of-Concept)

## Overview
This trap monitors liquidity levels on the Dexter Token and triggers responses based on significant changes in liquidity.

---

## What It Does
* Monitors liquidity levels on the Dexter Token.
* Triggers if liquidity drops below a certain threshold.
* It demonstrates the essential Drosera trap pattern using deterministic logic.

---

## Key Files
* `src/LiquidityTrap.sol` - The core trap contract containing the monitoring logic.
* `src/SimpleResponder.sol` - The required external response contract.
* `drosera.toml` - The deployment and configuration file.

---

## Detection Logic

The trap's core monitoring logic is contained in the deterministic `shouldRespond()` function.

## 🧪 Implementation Details and Key Concepts
* **Monitoring Target:** Watching the liquidity levels on the Dexter Token at 0xFba1bc0E3d54D71Ba55da7C03c7f63D4641921B1.
* **Deterministic Logic:** This logic is always executed off-chain by operators to achieve consensus before a transaction is proposed.
* **Calculation/Thresholds:** Uses a fixed liquidity threshold to determine when to trigger the response.
* **Response Mechanism:** On trigger, the trap calls the external Responder contract, demonstrating the separation of monitoring and action.

## Test It
To verify the trap logic using Foundry, run the following command (assuming a test file has been created):

bash
forge test --match-contract LiquidityTrap
